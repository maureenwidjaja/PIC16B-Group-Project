# Book Recommendation System

In this project, we utilized ..... to scrape the data from .....

Initially, we used [BeautifulSoup](https://github.com/maureenwidjaja/PIC16B-Group-Project/blob/78391161c60e94ca5244c0a87bc584f422f1fd29/PIC16B_group_project_BeatifulSoup.ipynb) to scrape the data from Open Library. However, after noticing that it parses the web at an extremely slow rate, we decided to use [Scrapy](https://github.com/maureenwidjaja/PIC16B-Group-Project/tree/78391161c60e94ca5244c0a87bc584f422f1fd29/openlibrary_project) instead as it allows us to parse the web asychronously. However, after encountering multiple issues, we decided to use another method (insert new method here). The issues with Scrapy were mainly due to too many requests being sent to the server, which led us to being blocked by the website, and due to the fact that Open Library is not a popular platform where people review books in general. Moreover, books that have 'ratings' are not guarenteed to have 'reviews'. The quantity in which books are rated are low and books that are reviewed are even smaller in quantity. Therefore, we changed our method.
